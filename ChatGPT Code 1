# Step 2: Load financial data for all public firms

# Load a list of tickers of all public firms
all_tickers = pd.read_csv('https://yourwebsite.com/all_tickers.csv')['Ticker'].tolist()

# Filter tickers by sectors that are winning during hyperinflation and economic recession
winning_sectors = ['Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Consumer Discretionary']

# Retrieve financial data for selected tickers
financial_data = yf.download(all_tickers, start='2022-01-01', end='2023-04-25')


# Step 3: Filter firms based on accounting ratios

# Calculate current ratio and interest coverage ratio
financial_data['Current_Ratio'] = financial_data['Current Assets'] / financial_data['Current Liabilities']
financial_data['Interest_Coverage_Ratio'] = financial_data['Operating Income'] / financial_data['Interest Expense']

# Filter firms with current ratio > 3 and interest coverage ratio > 4
filtered_data = financial_data[(financial_data['Current_Ratio'] > 3) & (financial_data['Interest_Coverage_Ratio'] > 4)]


# Step 4: Calculate market price power indicators

# Calculate ROA and ROE
filtered_data['ROA'] = filtered_data['Net Income'] / filtered_data['Total Assets']
filtered_data['ROE'] = filtered_data['Net Income'] / filtered_data['Total Equity']


# Step 5: Select top firms based on ROA and ROE

# Select top 10 firms based on ROA and ROE
selected_firms = filtered_data.nlargest(10, ['ROA', 'ROE'])


# Step 6: Calculate portfolio volatility

# Calculate annualized volatility for each selected firm
selected_firms['Volatility'] = np.sqrt(252) * selected_firms['Close'].pct_change().rolling(window=30).std()

# Filter firms with portfolio volatility < 10%
final_selected_firms = selected_firms[selected_firms['Volatility'] < 0.1]


# Step 7: Display the final list of tickers

# Display the final list of tickers
